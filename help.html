<p>This OSKit App allows users to record basic oceanographic data. The following fields are currently available</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ocean Temperature</b> (celcius)</li>
<li><b>Ocean Salinity</b> (psu)</li>
<li><b>Sechi Disk depth</b> (meters) as a proxy for turbidity</li>
<li><b>Basic Weather</b> as a % of cloudiness</li>
<li><b>Image</b> (a photo taken by the device</li>
</ul>


<p>Each measurement can be taken asynchonosly as each is saved in its own individual file which is then transmitted to the server as a separate file</p>

<p>More to come. Each measurement can be taken asynchonosly as each is saved in its own individual file which is then transmitted to the server as a separate file</p>
